While market sentiment shows a weak 'Bullish' lean, it is contradicted by the strong macro headwinds and acknowledges market struggles. Critically, without any technical indicator data (RSI, MACD) to suggest underlying strength or a potential bounce, holding this position in a 'Risk-Off' environment, already at a loss and nearing the stop-loss, is an unjustified risk.

While the market sentiment is broadly 'Bullish', the 'mixed market conditions' and, more importantly, the lack of specific technical indicators (RSI, MACD) for this asset prevent a confident assessment of a potential rebound. Given the primary goal to protect capital, allowing the position to fall further to hit the stop-loss is less prudent than exiting now. The trade has shown weakness by failing to hold its gains. As a disciplined trader, cutting losses promptly to protect capital for future opportunities is prioritized over gambling on a recovery without clear supportive data.

The macro analysis explicitly states 'underlying market structure remains robust... signaling potential for future upside.' Without specific technical indicators (RSI, MACD) provided, I must heavily weigh the strong fundamental and sentiment backdrop. Rather than locking in a minor loss, it's prudent to give the position room to recover and potentially exceed previous highs, aligning with the positive market outlook.
