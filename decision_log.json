While technical indicators like RSI are neutral, the price action confirms resistance at or around the target profit level. As a prudent profit-taker, securing profits after the target has been met and a slight pullback occurred is the most intelligent strategy to protect gains.",

      "justification": "The initial take-profit target of 1.5% has been not only met but exceeded, with the current P/L at 1.80%. Crucially, the current P/L is higher than the recorded `highPnlPercent` of 1.64%, indicating renewed upward momentum rather than a pullback. Technical indicators (RSI 56.15) are neutral, not signaling overbought conditions, suggesting further room to run. The macro environment is supportive with a 'Risk-On' regime. Given these factors and the absence of technical exhaustion, it's prudent to let profits run further while intelligently protecting gains by increasing the target.",

While the macro environment is moderately bullish and technicals (RSI 50.62) are neutral and not indicative of exhaustion, the primary goal is to be a prudent profit-taker. Locking in profits that have already materialized and met the predefined target is the judicious action rather than holding for potentially more, especially after a slight pullback from the peak.",
