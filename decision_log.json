While the macro environment is moderately bullish and technicals (RSI 50.62) are neutral and not indicative of exhaustion, the primary goal is to be a prudent profit-taker. Locking in profits that have already materialized and met the predefined target is the judicious action rather than holding for potentially more, especially after a slight pullback from the peak.",
